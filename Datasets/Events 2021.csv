The data collaboratives practices had enabled participants from different background within Government institutions and journalists to understand the value of data even those they have considered ""meaningless"" in the beginning. Together, we were able to create a fictional but potential ""SMS Disease Surveillance"" system that can be used to monitor Covid19 outbreak in Madagascar if some data from private company would be available.

The possibility of developing a mobile app for better Covid-19 logistic management was also presented after group discussion.","We learned that partnerships with government and the private sector can be useful but need some incentive measures (fiscal, for example) from local authorities to publish data.

The eight-hour training trained the students the basics in data journalism by explaining in detail the concept of open data, how to scrap and clean data to create open data, laws regulating data journalism in Tanzania, data analysis, data visualisation and how to develop data-driven stories from open data for radio, TV, newspapers and online platforms. 

The training was a unique opportunity to the students since they got a chance to learn and practise new skills that can make them competitive in the current job market after finishing their studies.

Conducting such training with students was a stepping stone to creating better journalists who can add value in their reporting and producing content that can impact lives in future.
","One of the foremost lessons learnt from the students is that data journalism is not taught completely in colleges or universities offering journalism or mass communication courses in Tanzania. Nearly all the lessons were new to the students and they acknowledged that the opportunity gave them exposure and the skills were key in building their careers after school.

At Nukta Africa we learnt that there are useful open data dashboards by the government and other stakeholders which are not commonly used and known to most people. Also, former famous open data dashboards like opendata.go.tz are no longer available to the public. Therefore, conducting these training makes people aware and informed on data that could help them in business, reporting and decision making.

Furthermore, emphasis on maximising the use of open data in the community through data journalism is one the best way to utilise the resources available. Open data dashboards may not yield expected results if journalists cannot use the data to find stories relevant to their community. Data-driven stories with contexts from ground reporting has proved to be more effective in increasing transparency and by accounting people in power. ","We love Open Data Day because, as data experts or data journalists, we get an opportunity to celebrate and push for the greater use of open data in our community in creating impactful stories or insights that will help people make informed decisions.",,data-journalism-for-accountability,EAT,https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=15cQBKnNF_obcDnNZC4QgSrUUEM1RPbR0,EMEA,"Europe, Middle East & Africa"

We had 58 people participating in the event, including civil society representatives, university students, and the CoST Honduras technical team. At the beginning of the event, CoST's LATAM Regional Manager welcomed the attendees and made a brief introduction about Open Data Day and why it is important for CoST.

We then had the participation of CoST's Head of Members and Affiliates, who presented the advances in the use of open data that CoST programs are achieving worldwide. One of the examples she presented was the Transparent Infrastructure Open Data Portal, a tool designed and developed by the CoST Ukraine program to analyze more than 7000 public infrastructure contracts. The analytical report is available at [https://portal.costukraine.org/graph.html](https://portal.costukraine.org/graph.html). The third participation was from one of CoST Honduras' project managers who presented the programme's effort to design and develop a data analysis tool named InfraS. This tool aims to measure indicators built from public infrastructure data, identify red flags and issues, and present recommendations to the correspondent authorities on how they can fix those issues to achieve sustainable infrastructure.

The next part of the event was a more interactive session where the participants, divided into four groups, were able to talk to CoST's experts and answer some questions aimed at identifying potentially user data needs for the InfraS tool.","We learned that the feedback from active citizens could benefit the ways the government discloses information, especially when, in most cases, data from local governments is not easy to access. Moreover, we learned that these kinds of events help us get feedback about citizen's data needs which is a valuable input for the design and development of the analytics dashboards.",It is a space that allows us to connect with people from all over the world and learn from their experiences using open data and creating solutions for global problems.,,datos-abiertos-en-infraestructura,CST,https://costhonduras.hn/,AMER,The Americas

The theme for the event was, ‘Leveraging data on abuse of female journalists in Ghana to promote equal development within the digital ecosystem in Africa,’ and was joined by over 40 participants across the continent.

Co-founder of iWatch Africa, Moro Seidu delivered a presentation with focus on the current data on abuse of women journalists in Ghana. Moro stressed that “although the introduction of social media has enhanced communication and participation on social media platforms, it has not been friendly on the female gender.”

Moro cited iWatch Africa 2020 data which showed that while the number of male journalists monitored were three times more than their female counterparts, 46 per cent of the total number of online abuses recorded by iWatch Africa were directed at women journalists in Ghana.

Second speaker, Nashilongo Gervaslus blamed the patriarchal upbringing in many homes across the continent for the sort of accountability which treats women with a different sort of lens and opens them up to abuse. She recommended that governments across the continent introduce cyber-crime legislation to protect women online.

Our final speaker Sheilah Birgen, also stressed the need for newsrooms to provide support for female journalists and protect them against online misogyinistic mobs. Sheilah also argued that, “the stigma relating to these abuses deters some women from speaking about it.”

The event ended with a resolution led by Gideon Sarpong, to work on mainstreaming digital rights units in 50 newsrooms in West Africa to mitigate the risks that online harassment of women journalists poses to the press freedom and equal development within the digital ecosystem in Africa.",More work need to be done to gather data on abuse of women journalists online across Africa.,It helps deepen transparency and accountability in Africa.,,leveraging-data-on-abuse-of-female-journalists-to-promote-equal-development-with,GMT,,EMEA,"Europe, Middle East & Africa"

We chose this project as it has been one of the biggest projects initiated by the current government to overcome climate change but at the same time had been under scrutiny due to corruption allegations. 

The event started with the team evaluating the available data in the monitoring report published by WWF (third party). After understanding the datasets and their correlations, the team came up with a plan to share a consolidated dataset containing the location data of nurseries and the total number of tree saplings sown in the area. With this subset of data, the team was only able to map around 12.6% of the total trees planted (1 billion) as the rest of the information (number of plantation) was not published in the report. The motivation behind working on this subset of data was to publish something meaningful for the developers as well as plotting the available data on a map to make it understandable for the public. 

The team was divided into three parts. The first team was responsible for segregating and cleaning the datasets, the second team combined the data from different tables, processed it, and converted it into a machine-readable format and the third team worked on a public-facing dashboard where these coordinates were to be mapped.

At the end of the event, the team was able to publish the dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/aliirz/billion-tree-tsunami) as well as the map of all the coordinates through ArcGIS (https://arcg.is/1jmbjm). This proof of concept will now be shared with relevant government agencies working on the climate and environment to open further datasets that can make this initiative more transparent and accountable.","Play smart: To get started with an open data project, there is already tons of data available online in legacy formats that can be used. This data can be in the form of PDF reports either published by the agencies themselves or by third parties.

Gain trust: This raw data can be used to develop a proof of concept and can then be shared with the relevant agencies to get them excited. The proof of concept can also be handed over to the agencies to explore other possibilities.

Open data: Once these agencies see value in opening up the data and how it can be used to achieve their organisational goals, they will come on board and provide access to the required data. That is where the real magic happens!",It is always a pleasure to see so many like-minded people coming together to show the importance of open data and how can it be used to fight the biggest challenges being faced by the public sector across the globe.

A panel of local experiences sought to present success stories from each city related to the use, reuse and / or publication of open data for citizen benefit, as well as the challenges that lie ahead at the local level. In addition to this, the event held a series of workshops focused on the use of environmental data, a topic that is of common interest to most citizens of León. 

Workshops:

1) Open data, analyzing data on air quality and its pollutants
2) Open source, data collection of trees and native species in the urban environment
3) Open mapping, visualizing water management infrastructure

We used open source tools to gather, process and view data in order to co-design solutions as well as to raise awareness about environmental issues. This was possible thanks to the collaboration of:

After, Aimee Zambrano Ortiz, founder of the femicide monitor, introduced the monitor and shared our data and methodology. After, Sahili intervened with the importance of feminist data and the relation between gender and social science, and finally we opened the floor for questions and answers, which lasted almost 40 minutes. The debate was exquisite. Our webinar lasted 1hr and 59 minutes.

For the promotion of the event we published [an entry on our website](https://utopix.cc/anexos/open-data-day-monitoreando-femicidios-en-venezuela-con-utopix/). Then, we designed a flyer and shared it through Whatsapp, Facebook and [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/p/CL5T6iMB7Vl/) along a [Google Registration form](https://forms.gle/vwj7rB3U8NHs7dPb8) so participants could register and we could gather info regarding who was interested: we asked for names, emails, countries, how had they known of the activity and if they wanted to be part our mail list. Then, a day before the event, we shared the Zoom link with the 77 registered persons from Latin America, America and the US. Of that total, 23 participated in the webinar and by the time we were done, 21 were in the room, most of them form Venezuela. The number remained throughout the whole session. The link on the Facebook page has more than 400 views.","What we’ve learned:
1) Promote the event widely in advance. We did it with less than a week from the event.
2) Centralise and optimise the automatic mail response with the Zoom link after people have registered. MailChimp is our best choice so far, as it’s the engine we use in our website. Sending emails with the event link manually is exhausting and has a human error range.
3) Ask for phone numbers in the registration form as it helps to send a reminder of the event.
4) Hosting the event through Zoom (or other platform) in parallel with YouTube or Facebok is definitely a great idea; afterwards we have a secure link for sharing our event so people can watch it.
5) The moderator cannot be a panelist as well. Although it was a success, it worked because there were twenty or so people in the room. If there had been more it would have been difficult to tend to both roles.","It was an amazing opportunity to not only share data across the globe, but to bring together people from different localities and countries in a single space and share knowledge and points of view regarding gender-based violence in its femicide form, the situation in Latin America, and how we have been working to shift the world. It's a special and incredible important event for human kind, and we do hope to continue participating in it.

Due to Covid-19, the event was held with strict security measures, and a live broadcast was made for people who for health reasons could not attend personally. 

The event was developed with three short presentations, which served to initiate the debate and collaborative work with the participants who attended the event and those who followed the live broadcast. The proposed topics covered the tools and laws of transparency, participation and open data in Argentina, the comparative sample of open data from official national and local environment web pages and how to use them, and finally the invited organization ""Ecos D Mar"" made an exhibition of data on oil exploitation in the Argentine seas, its negative impact on the environment and the actions that the organization carried out to try to preserve the environment and marine fauna. 

After each talk, discussions were held between the attendees and the speakers, to try to reach conclusions and solutions to the problems raised. The attendees participated with great enthusiasm in each debate proposed at the event. 

Finally, we must emphasise that, as every year, the representation of gender was very important. Of the 3 speakers, 2 were women and the third a man. Likewise, the audience was mostly women.","This year's event left great lessons, both for our organisation and for the invited organizations and those who attended the event. They demonstrated the importance of collaborative work between environmental organisations and organisations specialized in working with data and technology. The event showed the enormous possibilities that open data provide through its analysis and processing to predict environmental impact. 

The event served to demonstrate the enormous importance of citizen commitment to prevent negative environmental impacts and preserve the environment and the great importance that civil society organizations have in controlling the acts of governments and companies that can affect the environment. Attendees learned about the legal instruments of participation and transparency that can be used to participate in public life.",Open Data Day is a perfect opportunity that allows our organisation to convene citizens and other organisations in our community to work together with data and show them the enormous advantages that these allow to intervene in public life and in the creation of public politics. It also allows us to show the entire community the importance of transparency to have more efficient administrations that respond to people's needs,,open-data-ambiente-y-desarrollo-sostenible,ART,http://escueladefiscales.com/index.php/oddmdq/,AMER,The Americas

Since 2015, up to 100 meters of lands have been taken by water destroying houses and threatening many others in various coastal cities in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Burundi, Tanzania and Zambia. 

In the framework of finding adaptive measures due to the rapid rise of the lake and strengthen the resilience of populations living in the risk areas. On the occasion of Open Data Day 2021, Mijas Multimedia organised an event whose overall goal was to use open data in strengthening the community resilience to the rapid rise of Lake Tanganyika. The project aimed at raising the awareness to the local community on the use of risk data in protecting exposed citizens. 

During the event, more hands-on than theoretical activities were carried out including;• Spatial image comparison and analyzing: this process comprised of taking up to date spatial images in the field with drone<br>• Image analysis: this process consisted of comparing spatial images taken by drone in the field with out-of-date images from Google Maps (after analysis we realized that the Google Maps image of the city is from 2019) in the goal of understanding the advance level of the lake and project next social economic infrastructures<br>
• Risk communication: this process consisted of sharing the data through various formats including spatial mapping and media outreach in the aim of informing those living under risk areas

After the event’s completion, the local authorities promised to take into account data produced during the event in reducing the disaster risk to exposed communities living at the coasts of Lake Tanganyika.",We’ve learned various lessons during and after the event’s completion including;<br>• The lack of knowledge of local authorities on how to tackle the rapid of Lake Tanganyika and the ignorance about the existence of the open data concept<br>• The authorities’ involvement in the promotion of open data through the increasing of data transparency,"Apart from defending the open data concept across the world, Open Data Day is the event that covers some local challenges in giving them an international outreach.

We had participant both online and onsite attend the event. a total of 32 people were onsite and 21 people online. 

Data were drawn from UNICEF, Nigeria Bureau of statistics and Water Aid were used as reference points for the discussion where it said 3 in 10 people in Nigeria don't have safe water close to home, 3 in 5 people in Nigeria don't have a toilet of their own.; 4 in 5 people in Nigeria lack handwashing facilities at home. 60 million Nigerians, or 33 per cent of the population, do not have access to safe water. We displayed out communities in Plateau state, Kaduna and the country's capital Abuja, where it can be seen that 10 in 10 people had no access to safe water, 5 in 5 not having access to handwashing facilities, with our research, we discovered that lack of access to WASH facilities is greatly caused by corruption, access to data, which leads to low participation of citizens in governance and its processes. To change this narrative, we built the capacity of participants on budget data sieving, how to effectively use the Freedom of Information Act as a tool for demanding information on the project and providing oversight on its implementations, leveraging social media as a tool for engaging government officials and amplifying corrupt cases in their communities.

Garba, a participant highlighted how he used the FOI and social media to engage and amplify corrupt practices as well as amplify the living conditions of people around his community, but it came with a price, he was invited by the government security agency for questioning, but he was able to get out of it easily as he posted on social media, and tagged relevant CSOs which came to his aid with legal council.

Another participant, Precious Adigwe was concerned about how citizens in rural communities are able to have the knowledge of data since it is complex and it is hard for them to understand and make actionable decisions. Wilson Atumeyi explained that in such cases, it is even unwise to use their local languages to make print works, as some of them can not read their local dialect, so it is advisable to make creative designs that when you have a glance at them, you will know what it means without reading a text, then get someone that understands their language to take them on the session for better understanding.

Finally, we agreed to create a knowledge-sharing platform where members can share data sieved for better engagement and a coalition that would ensure that this information is used to drive transparency and accountability in governance. ","Data is very important to driving accountability and transparency in governance. It is essential to always engage people even if you think they have knowledge of the concept, because most of our participants did not know the concepts of open data, open government or freedom of information.",It creates platform for dialogue and engagement on data and how citizens can leverage it for accountability.,,the-realities-of-wash-data,WAT,http://bit.ly/WaterWideODD2021,EMEA,"Europe, Middle East & Africa"

Japan,2021-03-06,公共交通オープンデータ最前線 in インターナショナルオープンデータデイ,,"コロナ禍によって公共交通が大きな打撃を受けた2020年度、その中でも公共交通オープンデータの整備は全国に着実に拡がり、現在、300近い公共交通事業者がオープンデータを提供しています。2017年頃、地方のバス事業者やコミュニティバスから始まったオープンデータは旅客船などにも拡がっており、県によるデータ整備研修なども全国各地で開催されております。首都圏では、都バスや鉄道車両のリアルタイムデータが公共交通オープンデータ協議会によって公開され、Google Mapsへの掲載が大きな注目を集めました。

このオンラインイベントでは、全国で公共交通オープンデータの整備や活用などに関わる皆様から、最新の事例をご紹介頂きます。それぞれ異なる状況の中でどのようにデータ整備に取り組んだか、公開されたデータをどのように活用したかなど、最新の事例を踏まえて活発に議論出来ればと思っています。ライトニングトーク（LT）も募集するので、すでに取り組んでいる方だけでなく、公共交通オープンデータに関心のある幅広い方の積極的なエントリーを期待します。",,13:30,https://twitter.com/niyalist/status/1367345316089892869,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSlbFfLNDdY,False,35.7125381,139.7591137,,False,50,True,,公共交通オープンデータ,Tokyo,,,,,gong-gong-jiao-tong-opundetazui-qian-xian-in-intanasiyonaruopundetadei,JST,https://iodd2021.peatix.com/view,APAC,Asia & The Pacific
